LBL EA1. Project: A game
A small character moves around a drawn maze and
"eats" the objects in its path

O-notation = O(1); It runs in linear time.

Wiring: The lcd screen and joystick are wired as usual. An image of the wiring is included.

The function for eating the white characters is glitchy and the user may need to move the cursor over a point multiple times to earn a point. 
Also the function that determines when the character is at the endzone is glitchy and the user may need to move it there multiple times.
The time displayed at the end of the game is in milliseconds.
The score displayed at the end of the end is the number of characters eaten multiplied by 2.

The only other file that the code calls is lcd_image.h
